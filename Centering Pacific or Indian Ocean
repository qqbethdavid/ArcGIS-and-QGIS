To center the map in either the Pacific or Indian you simply reproject the data. 
One projection that can be used is WGS 1984 PCD Mercator. This is the Projected
CRS in World.

In my case I was trying center the map in Australia so I tried to view it first
I found a workaround by showing the map in Layout view, clicking the map and 
right click to look for Properties/Coordinate System and from there I can create 
a custom or  select any CRS and modify it. In my case I chose the Projected WGS 
1984 Plate Carree and clicked modify and changed the central meridian to 150.000
to situate it to Australia (150 I'm guessing is a longitude situated somewhere near
Sydney). Then you can click Apply and then Ok. This is a procedure to view how it 
goes. To entirely change the map in this projection you'll have to project 
using the projection stated using the Arc toolbox.

Now this created an eez map that is centered in Australia but the problem that arose is 
a line that cannot be erased arosed from the area where it was split when it was
in a GCS_WGS_1984 projection (where Africa is center and Pacific is split). In this
case use the Arc toolbox and go to Data Management Tools/Feature Class/Integrate. 
for the tolerance I only used what I googled in stackoverflow on how they did it. 
But their case is different from mine since their split is actually a gap which is 
510 m. Mine doesn't seem to have a gap but I used 510 m anyways and it worked some-
how. Also remember that when you integrate there will be changes in the shapefile 
Some lines or holes may disappear (if your polygon has holes). In my case some 
holes (which represent islands) disappeared so I had to use Erase in Toolbox to
gain them again (erase input is Big map). Also remember that when you use integrate 
use it only on the said polygons with issues and not the whole shapefile. I selected 
only the polygons with the split lines.
