There was a time the Iterate Feature Selection in Model Builder did not work. 
I use this tool to be able to separate one single shapefile which consists of many shapefiles
in it.

I used to to do it  in my folders and it worked, but now it does not seem to be working. 
It is possible there is something in my folders which have a problem with the naming. 
Probably something with a space or too much nesting of the folders. 

I did it in the Default geodatabase and it worked
