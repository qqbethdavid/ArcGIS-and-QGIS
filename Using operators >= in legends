I couldn't really see a greater than and equal sign exactly on the keyboard. I tried looking in the 
character map but it doesn't seem to be listed there or I just missed it because I didn't have time 
to thoroughly check because of too many things to do. I scoured through stackoverflow and found a 
solution

Alt + 242 works for changing the symbology, but doesn't seem to work if you want to change the symbol in a legend.

Don't mind the message where "it doesn't seem to work in legend".It actually works in legend because you'll convert 
the legend to graphics and then ungroup them so that you can make alterations to the text in the legend. 
That's what I did. although the resulting greater than or equal sign was just too small so I isolated it and made it 
bigger.
