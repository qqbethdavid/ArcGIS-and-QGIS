This happens sometimes because one of your layers in the arc project is in gcs. Most of the time you'll need to 
reproject your main layer to pcd mercator (along with the world map if still doesn't work). There are times also 
that even if you projected it to pdc it still has a gap. I don't know if it's some kind of glitch. 

But it is possible that the larger the cells the less gap to be seen and the smaller the cell size the more the gap is seen
(but that is only my theory I don't know if it has a basis at all).

What I did was I had one layer which was successfully reprojected and had no gaps. Then I had a second layer which 
had a gap. THe correct raster is the one with the gap, that's what I was going to use but couldn't because of that 
gap. So what I did was I put the first layer (without gap) under the one with the gap so that it will not show any 
gaps at all.
