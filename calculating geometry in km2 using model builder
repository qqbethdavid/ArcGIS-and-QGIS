In ModelBuilder, drop in the Calculate Field tool (under Data Management | Fields toolbox) and use the expression !shape.area@acres! (make sure Expression Type is PYTHON or PYTHON_9.3.)

Or, in ArcPy: arcpy.CalculateField_management(YourFeature, Field, "!shape.area@acres!", "PYTHON", "")

It's possible to use a wide range of units for both area and length calculations this way:

Shape and length properties of the geometry field can be modified with unit types expressed with an @ sign.
