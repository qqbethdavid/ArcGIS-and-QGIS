TO change the CRS and compute the area using the Cylindrical Equal area you type the formula:

area(transform($geometry, 'EPSG:4326', 'USER:100001'))/1000000  

write first the orginal CRS of the polygon and next write the CRS you want the polygon to be 
converted to. This will produce area values that are in CEA. 

I tried converting the polygon to the user 100001 but it looks really skewed. It is possibly 
like that because when I inspected the info in the CRS it is does not have an extent. So a 
weird long polygon shows up in the northern part of the world map. So converting the polygon 
to be able to compute for area is not advisable for QGIS. 

Also if you converted the polygon to CEA in Arc. You can load this is QGIS and compute the 
area but you will have to change the Project properties. (Go to Project/Properties and 
change the measurement to none/planimetric and Square kilometers). This actually worked. But still 
you can't use the polygon because it just might also be skewed for some reason. I haven't tried.

Calculating polygon areas in shapefile using QGIS

How do I calculate areas of an area shapefile in square meters (mÂ²) or in acres (ha)?

I didn't find that functionality in the Vector Tools.
