In arcgis you should use polygon to raster in arc toolbox. I was not successful when I used feature to polygon. 
you must use a vector extent something similar to the raster you are going to make as processing extent.  This helps in fitting the raster
into the polygon cells. But it will not perfectly work without adjusting the raster cell size. I made a trial and 
error in finding the right cell size using the processing extent.
