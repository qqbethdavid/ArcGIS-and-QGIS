I am reinstalling ArcGIS on QQ007. I used the file in the setup_ArcGIS and used the pvrs file in there
as well (but the pvrs file does not work). I noticed when I used this ArcGIS iso file I was able to change the host name in the 
ArcGIS Administrator to the name of the computer. I used QQ007 (don't use localhost it doesn't work). 

When I used the ArcGIS in the other files in my D:\ I couldn't change the name of the host. So always use the 
one in the folder setup_ArcGIS. Erase the other arcgis.
