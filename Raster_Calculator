creating zero values from null values of a raster:
  This is if you have one or two pixels with your actual values for your first raster and you want to add this to another raster which is much 
  larger and not of the same extent as your first raster. When you add the rasters together simply using the plus operator it will only 
  give you an intersection of the rasters as the sum. This script will create actual values of your first raster, whatever value it is you 
  want. 

  Con(IsNull(raster), 0, 3)  

for this case I wanted to create zero values for null areas and keep my single pixel at 3. 

reference from ArcGIS 
An example of using a complex expression in the Con tool is:

OutRas = Con(InRas < 15, 10, 1)

In the above expression, if the value of a cell in InRas is less than 15, 10 will be assigned to that cell location (true) on the output raster; 
otherwise, cell values greater than or equal to 15 will be assigned 1 (false) on the output raster.
If no value or expression is specified for the false expressions:

OutRas = Con(InRas < 15, 10)
